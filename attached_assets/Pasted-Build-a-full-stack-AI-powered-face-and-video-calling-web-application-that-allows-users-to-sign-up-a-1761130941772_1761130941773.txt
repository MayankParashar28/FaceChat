Build a full-stack AI-powered face and video calling web application that allows users to sign up, authenticate using facial recognition, and conduct real-time video calls with AI-based features like emotion detection, smart filters, and attendance tracking. The app should have a sleek, modern, and minimal design similar to Google Meet or Zoom but with an AI twist.
